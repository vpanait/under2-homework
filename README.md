## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

We've put together a short code exercise so we can better understand your development capabilities and problem soliving skills. We don't want to ask for too much of your time for this exercise, let's see what you can achieve in 2 hours.

## Part 1 â€” Getting set up

- [ ] Fork this repo before you begin
- [ ] Clone the repo on your local machine
- [ ] Install project dependencies
- [ ] Get your development server running

## Part 2 â€” Deploying to netlify

- [ ] Wire up a free netlify account to your git repo
- [ ] build the next project to a new netlify site
- [ ] add the site name here --> https://guileless-madeleine-326216.netlify.app/

## Part 3 â€” Performance troubleshooting

Our site is fast out of the box but there are a couple of quick wins we can grab to speed the page up further.

- [ ] Run a lighthouse test (in a guest tab) and record the results
- [ ] Implement the 2 main oppurtunitues that lighthouse provides
- [ ] Run another lighthouse test and record the reult
- [ ] Push your progress to your github branch and trigger a build

## Part 4 â€” Finishing off the home page

- [ ] Using the `/content/latest-articles.json` file located in the root of this project, build out and populate the new latest articles page section
- [ ] Our client has asked for a newsletter signup form to be added to the site just above the footer. Using the designs in the `/designs` directory, build out the newsletter signup section ui

- [ ] Wire up the form so that submissions will post the form data to `https://under2.free.beeceptor.com/submit` with the following data structure:
      `{ firstName, lastName, email, company }`
- [ ] Push your progress to your github branch and trigger a build

## Part 5 - Finishing up

- [ ] Make sure the repo is public and share it with us
